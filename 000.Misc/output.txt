If there were ever a time to wake up to the sheer power of China's population, buying power, energy needs, consumer demands, and eventual military strength, that time is now.

Now, with advanced innovations like the Internet, wireless technology and nanotechnology, the possibility of China leapfrogging the world's other industrial powerhouses – the US, Japan, and Europe – will recast a new global order.

If we do not raise the bar on innovation, transform education, nurture entrepreneurship, and get on with encouraging science and engineering, we will be creating a destiny in which the Chinese dominate markets and eventually nations.

If economic power breeds political power, then we in the West had best recognize that we are facing the challenge of a rising new civilization, one that will have influence in all spheres on a scale we have never faced before.

We need a plan of action now or we will suffer the consequences of a reduced quality of life and an inability to compete on a global scale with China's workforce, economy and industry.
